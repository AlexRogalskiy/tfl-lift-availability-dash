# TFL Lift Dash

**Live Demo:** https://tfl-lift-dash.as93.net 

**The Problem:** When faults on lifts on the TFL network occur, it can take a short while for it to be detected and reported, even longer on unmanned DLR stations. 

**Our Solution:** We used computer vision on real-time CTTV footage to detect when issues on the escalators and lifts occurred, and then display the results on a dash-board. We thought this could be particularly useful for customers with reduced mobility, who are reliant on the lifts being operational. It could also be useful for the maintainers, to understand which lifts are out of service and have the highest demand at present.

This is the dashboard component for our hackathon project. It is now using fake data, since we don't have proper access to all the tfl CTTV cameras in real-time :(
